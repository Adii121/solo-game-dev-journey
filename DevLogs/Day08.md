ðŸ“– Devlog: Day 8 â€“ UI Polish & Game Art Finalization
Date: July 8, 2025
Focus: UI Enhancement, Art Finalization, Gameplay Polish

ðŸŽ¨ What I Did Today:
âœ… 1. Score UI Upgrade
Replaced dull default text with a pixel-art inspired font for a retro-modern feel.

Added a background badge with rounded corners and transparency to improve readability against dynamic backgrounds.

Styled the text with:

White font (#FFFFFF).

Black outline (#000000) for contrast.

Subtle scaling animation on score increase to give a satisfying pop effect.

âœ… 2. Main Menu Polish
Redesigned the main menu for a clean and professional mobile look.

Added:

Title with a modern pixel vibe.

Centered buttons: Start, Quit.

Background styled for mobile resolutions.

Fixed rendering issues where background wasnâ€™t appearing.

Locked menu layout to portrait orientation for mobile.

âœ… 3. Restart Flow Enhancement
Polished the game over screen for a seamless restart flow.

Buttons now have proper hierarchy and UI layers:

Restart button immediately resets score and player state.

Quit button cleanly exits play mode or app.

Confirmed UI scales correctly on different resolutions.

âœ… 4. General Art Polish
Finalized art assets:

Player, Rickshaw, Environment.

Replaced all placeholder assets with themed visuals matching the game's vibe.

Added shadows under key objects for depth.

Adjusted building and sidewalk proportions for mobile-friendly visuals.
