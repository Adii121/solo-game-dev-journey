# ðŸš• Day 4

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Evolve visual style from rickshaw to a clearer taxi theme with improved player visibility and a top-down perspective.

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- Replaced rickshaw with a custom-built taxi (using sprite blocks)
- Attempted voxel-style camera tilt (reverted due to confusion)
- Set camera to proper top-down perspective behind the player
- Fixed issue where player or rickshaw wasnâ€™t visible on screen
- Cleaned up scene and removed unwanted GameObjects
- Fixed rickshaw spawn bug
- Balanced rickshaw spacing logic across different speeds
- Set up placeholder environment visuals with lane and border blocks
- Added side mirrors, better scaling, and center-aligned visuals for taxi
- Staging setup for future: Crossy Roadâ€“like art and modular buildings

---

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps for Day 5
- Design modular building sprites for left/right
- Add better background props (trees, lights, crosswalks)
- Begin creating object pooling system for optimized rickshaw spawn

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Notes
Current art style: Crossy Roadâ€“inspired (blocky, clean top-down)  
Camera: Orthographic, behind player, looking top-down  
Obstacles: Taxi (3D illusion via 2D blocks), fair spaced
